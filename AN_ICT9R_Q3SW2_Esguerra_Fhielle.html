After the unfortunate passing of Ely's girlfriend, Ely moves to Barcelona, Spain to fulfill his wishes when he meets a girl who reminds him of her. He tries to ignore the thought of her, but fate would always bring them together. Both struggle at first: but as they get know each other, things begin to feel lighter. Soon, Mia finds herself falling for Ely, who is not yet done loving someone else. With a strong voice of today's youth, this romantic-drama movie shows two people who are faced with the truth about themselves and about the past so that they can have a future together.</td>
